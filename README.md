Introducing SQIFI â€“ the revolutionary way to access advanced technology!

WELCOME TO ACCESS LIBRARY

**What Can I Discover?**

In this library, you can access advanced technology to learn and build with. 

**What Can I Build?**

Your only limit is your imagination! Design a variety of software, applications and protocols with a wide selection of technologies. 

Automate routines to gain supernatural powers.

**Before you get started**

- Bring a pad of paper and pen or your favorite device to keep *notes*.
- Find a location where you feel *safe*, calm and focused.
- Make sure you have a drink, *healthy* snacks and/or your favorite knickknack.
- Setup your physical environment to let in some *light* if not outdoors.
- Meditate for 2-5 min before *reading* a new section (frequencies work best).
- Get ready to *embark* on an *exciting* and *intellectual* journey.
